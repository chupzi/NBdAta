# All of the d3 is done in the grid.js file. The NBData.csv contains the data we used to create the project. The goal of this project is to show how the amount of three pointers taken in the NBA has drasticaly increased over time. The pixel graph displays NBA league per game data. The statistics were scaled by a factor of 600 in order to show the ratios of such statisitcs. The goal is for people to see how this ratio, the amount of shots in the NBA that are threes, has increased. The year can be changed either by using the drop down menu, or the slider. The statistics on the left side will change accordingly.
